"""dlt_sources/education/romania/european_nations/subjects/computing_science — DLT sources.

Per the **2026-08-24-wave-1-dlt-sources-domain-restructure-v1** openspec
change, this package was migrated from its legacy jurisdiction-first
location. The `__init__.py` re-exports the local source modules.

Legacy import paths still work via re-export shims at the old locations.
